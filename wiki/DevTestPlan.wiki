#summary Test plan for testing a new release.
#labels Phase-QA

= How to test a new release =

 * Check that VERSION matches About box's version (should be automatic)
 * Go through the sample wiki page to check that Wiki markup is parsing hasn't regressed

== Patch revision releases ==
Patch revision releases should never add or modify the DB schema, so they're slightly easier to QA.

== Minor revision releases ==
 * Try installation on an empty database (dropdb, createdb)
 * Try installation on an existing database (take personal db and install on it)

== Major revision releases ==
 * TODO DB upgrades
