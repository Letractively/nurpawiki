= How to install everything required by Ocsigen on Debian =

== Database installation ==

Read [DatabaseInstallationDebian] and follow instructions.  It's better to get Postgresql installed prior to attempting GODI installation.

== Installing GODI ==

 * `apt-get install libpcre3-dev`
 * `apt-get install libgdbm-dev`
 * `apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`
 * `apt-get install libpq-dev`
 * Download and install GODI as per its installation manual (http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/)

== Install Ocsigen through GODI ==

 * Install `apps-ocsigen` from `godi_console`.  If you're lucky, all the dependent packages will be automatically selected and installed.  If you're not lucky, you'll need to dance package installation rumba for a little while.
 
== Install packages required by Nurpawiki ==

 * Install `godi-extlib`
 * Install `godi-postgresql`
 * Install `godi-calendar`
