#summary Tutorial on how to use Nurpawiki

= Creating your very first page =

The first thing to do after installing and starting Nurpawiki is to point your browser at http://localhost:8080/view?p=WikiStart.

You will be greeted with an empty page:

Click edit to edit the main page:

..and after pressing save:

= Adding to-dos ==

Let's showcase the to-do feature of this wiki.  Let's make a page called "!NurpaWiki" and place the following contents on it:

{{{
= NurpaWiki project =

This page is used to take notes & draft actions for the Nurpawiki SW project.

== Ocsigen related ==
* [todo Send an introduction e-mail to Ocsigen mailing list once build flow & documentation is good enough for public review]

== Web documentation ==
* [todo Write a short description of Nurpawiki on the Project Home]
* [todo Take screenshots of Nurpawiki todo list]
* [todo Take screenshots of Nurpawiki scheduler]
}}}

You will note that the wikitext conforms mostly to the one used in !MediaWiki.  However, there is one notable exception: the `[todo <text>]` tag.

When you embed a `[todo]` in your wiki page, it will be picked up by the wiki parser and added to your global to-do list when you save the wiki page.

Here's a screenshot to illustrate what happens after you've saved your wiki page along with your to-do items:
