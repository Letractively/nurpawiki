#summary Upgrading to a newer release.

= How to upgrade to a newer release =
*NOTE: always take a database backup before upgrading!*

If you have compiled Nurpawiki yourself from source, you need to get the new source and compile it.

If you're using a packaged Nurpawiki, just install the latest package.

Configuration files may require changes from time to time.  See e.g., NurpawikiGodiInstallation for notes.

The nurpawiki database will be automatically upgraded when you try to access any of your Nurpawiki pages with your browser.  You're strongly recommended to backup your database before attempting an upgrade.

Note that it is *impossible to go back to an earlier version* of your database once you have upgraded to a later version.
