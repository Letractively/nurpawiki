#summary How to install Nurpawiki

= Installation =

== Install Ocsigen & other required packages ==

Install Ocsigen through [http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/ the GODI package manager].

Follow [OcsigenInstallation these instructions] to install Nurpawiki on Debian / Ubuntu.  If you encounter any problems, please file them as bugs into the issue tracker.

Successful installation should be easy enough on Debian testing and Ubuntu 7.x or above.  For Windows, I find it convenient to run Linux in vmware and use Linux for serving pages and Windows for browsing.

== Install Postgresql & create a database ==
See [DatabaseInstallationDebian Debian DB instructions] for instructions on installing using Debian's packages.

See [DatabaseInstallation DB from source] for installing everything from source (not recommended).

== Get the source ==
Get the source from SVN (see http://code.google.com/p/nurpawiki/source) or download the latest release (http://code.google.com/p/nurpawiki/downloads/list).

== Configure ==
Run configure like so:

{{{
# NOTE: This depends on the way you configured your
#       Postgresql.
# NOTE 2: Make sure the DBPORT is correctly set!  It needs to match your
#       Postgresql configuration variable (in pg_hba.conf)
# NOTE 3: See DB installation page for info on postgres user password & authentication
env DBNAME=nurpawiki DBUSER=postgres DBPORT=5432 DBPASSWD=<pass> ./configure > nurpawiki.conf.local
}}}

The script will complain if some of the dependent libraries are not installed via ocamlfind.

Pipe the output of `configure` to a file and pass it on to Ocsigen when you start the Ocsigen web server.

== Build Nurpawiki ==

Run `make`.

== Start server ==

Run 

{{{
ocsigen -c nurpawiki.conf.local
}}}

== Test it! ==
