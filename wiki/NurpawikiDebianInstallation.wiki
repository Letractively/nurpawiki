= Nurpawiki installation on Debian =

This page describes how to install Nurpawiki using the [http://packages.debian.org/experimental/nurpawiki Nurpawiki Debian package].


== 1. Package installation ==
Nurpawiki is currently only in Debian experimental, so it's likely that you need to include experimental packages in your `/etc/apt/sources.list`.

Install required Debian packages:

{{{
apt-get install postgresql
apt-get install nurpawiki
}}}

== 2. Database setup ==
With Lenny's PostgreSQL (version 8.3), the steps on the SQL server are (as user postgres):

 # Switch to user `postgres`
 # Create a user in the database: `createuser ${DBUSER}`
 # Create the database for Nurpawiki: `createdb -O ${DBUSER} -E UTF-8 ${DBNAME}`
 # Set a password for the user accessing the database:
   {{{
      psql ${DBNAME} ${DBUSER}
      ALTER ${DBUSER} PASSWORD '${DBPASSWORD}';
      \q
   }}}

You can take, for example, DBUSER=ocsigen and DBNAME=nurpawiki (beware of commands executed in psql shell).

== 3. Ocsigen configuration ==
A sample template for a configuration file is available in `/usr/share/doc/nurpawiki/examples`. Filling it with proper database user, database name and password will give you a `<file>` that can be run with `ocsigen -c <file>` (as root). Ocsigen will then be listening on port 8080, as user ocsigen, and be serving Nurpawiki only (at /). If satisfied, and if you don't use any other Ocsigen-based service, you can directly use that configuration file as /etc/ocsigen/ocsigen.conf and use the initscript to launch ocsigen. Of course, Nurpawiki can be used with other Ocsigen-based services, but you'll have to edit /etc/ocsigen.conf yourself.

At installation, a wiki user "admin" with an empty password is created.

If everything went right and Ocsigen was properly started, you should be able to get into Nurpawiki by navigating to [http://localhost:8080]
