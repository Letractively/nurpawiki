 # Review wiki documentation to ensure that the docs are up-to-date for the version to be released.  An easy way to do this is to read all wiki pages that are labeled with Docs-ReviewedFor-x.y where x.y is the prevous released major.minor version.  After approving a wiki page for the new version, label it with Docs-ReviewedFor-z.w where z.w is the upcoming release major.minor version.
 # Update VERSION to the version number being released
 # Make a release candidate out of the current head (record the revision number)
  * `svn export -r 158 https://nurpawiki.googlecode.com/svn/trunk nurpawiki-x.y.z`
  * `tar cf nurpawiki-x.y.z`
  * `cd nurpawiki-x.y.z`
  * Configure & build
 # QA the package according to [DevTestPlan]
 # Test the release candidate tarball with GODI (see GodiPackageRelease)
 # Snapshot current svn version
  * NOTE: Add main revision into submit message so that it's easier to diff against it
  * `svn cp -r 158 https://nurpawiki.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://nurpawiki.googlecode.com/svn/tags/x.y.z`
 # Update ReleaseNotes
 # Upload release tarball to download page
 # Finally release the GODI package (see GodiPackageRelease)
 # *Eat your own dog food*: Upgrade personal installation to use the release version from GODI.  This is good for various reasons:
  * New GODI releases of Nurpawiki don't start to lag behind, as the latest features are installed to my own personal installation via releases.
  * GODI package gets tested on a real installation
  * Setting up Nurpawiki from GODI gets tested and hopefully will become streamlined over time as I get reminded about the installation procedure on each release.
