#summary Postgresql database setup for Nurpawiki

= How to setup the Nurpawiki database with Postgresql =

The installation procedure here explains a setup in which you install Postgresql from source into your home directory.  I'm successfully using this setup.  

I don't know of any reasons why a system-wide installation of Postgresql wouldn't also work.

== Installing Postgresql ==

{{{
./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/postgresql-8.2.3
make
make install
}}}

== Create DB storage and our DB ==

Note the use of UTF-8!

{{{
# Create data storage
nurpamac:~/opt/postgresql-8.2.3 janne$ bin/initdb -E UTF-8 --locale=en_US.UTF-8 data

# Create DB:
nurpamac:~/opt/postgresql-8.2.3 janne$ ./bin/createdb -E UTF-8 nurpawiki
}}}

You can now start Postgresql (Postgresql prints this after successful installation):

{{{
Success. You can now start the database server using:

    bin/postgres -D /Users/janne/opt/psql/data
or
    bin/pg_ctl -D /Users/janne/opt/psql/data -l logfile start
